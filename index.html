          <h2>About myself</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome, my name is Maxime, I have been freshly graduated at ICHEC in Management Sciences and now I'm ready to become an expert in programming due to <strong><em>"Le Wagon"</em></strong>. I am convinced that my positive attitude and my eagerness to discover and learn new things will help me chase my goal, which is to be active in a dynamic, innovative and fast-paced business environment where I can take ownership of my work.
          </p>

                  <p>The Roman general Maximus is the most faithful support of the emperor Marc Aurelius, who led from victory to victory. Jealous of the prestige of Maximus, and still more of the love which the Emperor devotes to him, the son of Marcus Aurele, Commodus, suddenly arrogates to himself the power, then orders the arrest of the general and his execution. Maximus escapes his killers, but can not prevent the slaughter of his family. Captured by a slave trader, he becomes a gladiator and prepares his revenge.</p>

                  <p>The unlikely escape of a cunning murderer brings marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner to Ashecliffe Hospital, a mental asylum on a remote, windswept island. It appears that the woman has disappeared from a locked room and there are indications of appalling acts committed within the hospital. While the investigation stalls, Teddy realizes he has to face his own demons if he wants to leave the island alive.</p>
